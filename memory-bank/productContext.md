# Product Context

## Problem Statement

Music enthusiasts often struggle to track their album listening habits, backlog, and collection across multiple platforms. They need a centralized, dedicated space to manage their "to-listen" list, track progress, and rate albums, distinct from general streaming service libraries.

## Solution

Aldex is a personal album index and backlog manager. It allows users to:

- **Track Collection:** Maintain a library of albums with status (Library, Wishlist) and progress (Backlog, Active, Completed).
- **Manage Backlog:** Easily see what to listen to next.
- **Batch Edit:** Efficiently manage multiple albums at once (Archive, Delete, Change Status/Progress) with a streamlined UI that supports staged updates and smart defaults.
- **Rate & Review:** Add personal ratings and notes.
- **Filter & Sort:** Organize the collection by various criteria.

## User Experience Goals

- **Simplicity:** Clean, minimal interface focused on the album art and essential data.
- **Efficiency:** Quick actions for adding, editing, and moving albums between statuses.
- **Visual Appeal:** Grid-based layout that highlights album covers.
- **Responsiveness:** Works well on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Stability:** Smooth transitions and layout stability during interactions (e.g., batch mode).
