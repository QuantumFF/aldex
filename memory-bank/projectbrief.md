# Project Brief: Personal Album-Centric Music Tracking App

## Overview

A personal, single-user, desktop-first web application for tracking music albums. The app is opinionated, favoring manual control and intentional logging over automation or social features.

## Core Philosophy

- **Albums are the only first-class entity.**
- **Low Friction > Feature Completeness.**
- **Manual Control > Automation.**
- **Desktop-First UX.**

## Goals

- Long-term personal tracking and light archival.
- specific lifecycle management of albums (Wishlist -> Owned -> Active -> Listened).
- Minimalist but extensible design.
